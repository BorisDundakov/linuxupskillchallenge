RTFM - Read The Fucking Manual
* create a habit to manually check how a command works before googling/asking AI


* cp command:
	- turns out it has a lot more options than expected:
		--update == to only copy the file if the version is different(updated)
		--backup == make a backup of each existing destination file


* tldr command (optional) - provides a shorter, more concise manual

- not all commands have a manual, some work with 'help'


- man hier --> manual of the linux hierarchy; needs to be further studied


- by converion, files starting with a character of "." are considered hidden; 'ls' ignores them by default


example of a commands accepting switches:

	* use 'ls -ltra' instead of 'ls -l -t -r -a'


move files with 'mv' command, not with copy


pushd: changes to a new dir and saves the old dir in the histrory for popd laterx

* apt in Linux Mint is actually a wrapper of apt-get

apt-get is old, mainly used prior ubuntu 16.04

apt includes fewer, lower-level commands, because they are not neccessary for the average linux user

apt gives you enough to imstall, update, remove and search packages, but nothing more

apt-get upgrade cannot install new packages on its own, cannot upgrade kernel

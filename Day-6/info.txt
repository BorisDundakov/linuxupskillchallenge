    There are two “modes” - with very different behaviours
    Little or nothing onscreen lets you know which mode you’re currently in!

The two modes are “normal mode” and “insert mode”, and as a beginner, simply remember:

"Press Esc twice or more to return to normal mode"

The “normal mode” is used to input commands, and “insert mode” for writing text - similar to a regular text editor’s default behaviour.
